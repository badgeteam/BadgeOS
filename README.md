# Contributing
We are an open-source project, so we can always use more hands!
If you're new to this project and want to help, message us:
- [RobotMan2412](https://t.me/robotman2412) on telegram
- [Badge.team](https://t.me/+StQpEWyhnb96Y88p) telegram group

After that, see [Project structure](./docs/project_structure.md) for reference about how this project works.



# Prerequisites
- `git`
- `build-essential`
- `cmake`
- `gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu`
- `python3`
- `picocom`



# Build system
The build system is based on Makefiles and CMake.
The following commands can be used to perform relevant actions:

To select target chip, choose one of:
- `export BADGEROS_PORT=esp32p4`
- `export BADGEROS_PORT=esp32c6` (default)

Before building, first run: `make prepare`

To build: `make build`

To remove build files: `make clean`

To flash to an ESP: `make flash`

To open picocom: `make monitor`

To build, flash and open picocom: `make` or `make all`

To check code style: `make clang-format-check` (code formatting) and `make clang-tidy-check` (programming guidelines)

Build artifacts will be put into the `kernel/firmware` folder once the project was successfully built.
